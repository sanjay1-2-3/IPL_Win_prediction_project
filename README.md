# IPL_Win_prediction_project
Here, I am taking the IPL data from 2008-2015 to train my logistic regression model and then using that model to make win probability predictions for both the teams when second inning is going on. 
It considers all the data about the team's past record and the city in which the game is being played and then makes a prediction with an accuracy_score of 0.8.
